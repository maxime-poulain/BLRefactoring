This folder and its sub-folders contain the shared domain code which is used by
the DDD and DDDWithCqrs projects. The objective of this shared domain code is to
avoid code duplication between the two projects and make it easier for maintainability.

However, it is important to clarify that in a typical application scenario,
each Domain should be encapsulated within its respective Bounded Context.
While our approach deviates from this guideline for the purpose of these projects,
adhering to the Bounded Context principle is paramount in a
comprehensive application environment to prevent undesired dependencies and
preserve the independence of each Domain.
